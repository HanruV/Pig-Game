# Pig Game Rules

## General Rules

1. **Players take turns** rolling a single six-sided die.
2. On a player's turn:
   - They roll the die repeatedly and accumulate points for that turn.
   - They can choose to **"Hold"** at any time, which ends their turn and adds their accumulated points for that turn to their total score.

---

## Rolling a 1

- If the player rolls a **1**:
  - They lose all the points accumulated for that turn (but not their total score).
  - Their turn ends immediately, and the next player takes their turn.

---

## Winning the Game

- The first player to reach or exceed the target score (usually **100**) **wins**.
- If two players are close to the target score, the game continues until the current round is completed, ensuring each player has an equal number of turns.
